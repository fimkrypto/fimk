Alice has registered with the FIMKrypto association, she provided her strong 
authentication details to FIMKrypto that was then encrypted and stored in the 
blockchain together with her FIMKrypto account (FIM-BA8U-LVXC-WBFT-49C4S).

Bob runs a loan business where customers can apply for small loans online, Bob
runs a website that offers customers the posibility to authenticate themselves
before applying for a loan.

Alice wants to apply for a loan so she visits Bobs website. On the website she
is asked to identify herself during the registration process. Alice chooses to
identify herself with her strong FIMKrypto authentication.

Alice is asked to enter her FIMK account number (FIM-BA8U-LVXC-WBFT-49C4S) and
submit that to the website. The website now comes back with a special web address
that points to the FIMKrypto hosted web wallet.

https://fimkrypto.github.io/mofo/launch.html#/authenticate/FIM-BA8U-LVXC-WBFT- \
49C4S/Bob/https://bobloans.com/auth.php%3Fu=Alice&a=FIM-BA8U-LVXC-WBFT-49C4S

If we break up the address we'll see that it's made up of several parts.

1. The FIMKrypto web wallet address - https://fimkrypto.github.io/mofo/launch.html
2. The authenticate plugin          - #/authenticate/
3. Alice her account number         - FIM-BA8U-LVXC-WBFT-49C4S/
4. Bobs name to display             - Bob/
5. The return address               - https://bobloans.com/auth.php%3Fu=Alice&a= \
                                      FIM-BA8U-LVXC-WBFT-49C4S

Upon visiting that address Alice is taken to the web wallet where she is asked 
to login by providing her FIMK secret phrase. She is then asked if she agrees 
with sending her authentication information to Bob. The authentication 
information is now send to the address that Bob provided.

Upon receiving the authentication information Bob cryptographically verifies that
the data send by Alice matches the data that FIMKrypto has originally stored 
for Alice. If this checks out Bob can be assured that Alice is who she says she is.

For testing use this localhost version:

http://localhost:9000/#/authenticate/FIM-BA8U-LVXC-WBFT-49C4S/Bob/https://bobloans \
